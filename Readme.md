# EXPERIMENT 1 HELLO WORLD AND CALCULATOR PROGRAM
## NAME:PRATHAMESH
## PRN-24070123123

AIM : write a C program to print Hello world & perform various calculator operators

SOFTWARE USED: VS Code
The foundational concepts of C++—such as input and output operations, as well as basic arithmetic operators—were explored through simple programs like "Hello World" and a basic calculator. These examples provided a practical understanding of how data is inputted using cin and outputted using cout, laying the groundwork for more advanced programming in C++.

In C++, when data flows from an external device like a keyboard into the computer's main memory, this process is known as an input stream. It refers to the direction of data moving into the program, typically from the user.

On the other hand, when data moves from the main memory of the computer to an external device like the display screen, it's called an output stream. This process allows the program to present information or results to the user.

The cout object in C++ is part of the iostream library and is used for displaying output on the standard output device, which is usually the monitor. We use the insertion operator << with cout to send data to the screen.

Similarly, the cin object is an instance of the istream class and is used to take input from the standard input device, typically the keyboard. It works with the extraction operator >> to read data from the user and store it in variables within the program.

CONCLUSION OF THE PROGRAMS: MAKING A HELLO WORLD PROGRAM AND A SIMPLE CALCULATOR
